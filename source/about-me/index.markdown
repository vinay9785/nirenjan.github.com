My name is Nirenjan and I'm a 30-something Indian from Chennai,
currently working in the San Francisco Bay Area, California.

I dabble in the software world of C, C++, Perl, Python and most
recently, Ruby. (_Which is probably why you are seeing this blog written
in Markdown and published using Octopress_). 

My work involves high speed networks, packet processing, FIBs, MPLS,
assembly language programming, C hacking and much more, but you can get
all that from my [Linkedin profile][LinkedIn].

In my free time, I hack together new projects and share them on GitHub.
My projects include Linux device drivers, esoteric languages, and more.

On the side, I try to create new eats. (_I could call it "Good Eats",
but that would be trademark infringement_). People have survived my
_"experiments"_ so I think I'm pretty good at it.

I could go on and on, but that's unlike me, so check out my blog.
